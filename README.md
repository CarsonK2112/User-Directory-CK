# User Directory

With this app a user will be able to view and access employee information from an employee directory utilizing react. Dayjs was called in as an alternative to momentjs for ease of use (though I had to re-install it as it was unresolved for quite some time). Bootstrap was utilized for the layout, and the employees can be viewed in either ascending or descending order alphabetically. Be sure to run npm start to begin the application.
